<h1>Navtex messages analyzing tool</h1>

Navtex is an international automated direct-printing service for promulgation of
maritime safety information (MSI), navigational and meteorological warnings, meteorological
forecasts and other urgent safety-related messages to ships. It was developed to provide a
low-cost, simple and automated means of receiving MSI on board ships at sea in coastal
waters. The information transmitted may be relevant to all sizes and types of vessels and the
selective message-rejection feature ensures that mariners can receive MSI broadcasts which
are tailored to their particular needs.

Navtex messages must be constructed according to IMO NAVTEX MANUAL.
This tool represents an object, which upon calling on a message string produces IMO NAVTEX MANUAL
verification.
